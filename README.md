## Service microservice

The Service microservice contains 3 Models;
Technicians represent service staff identified by a unique employee_id along with their name.
Appointments capture scheduled service requests with details such as VIN, customer name, date and time, reason for service, VIP status, and the assigned technician. 
AutomobileVO model is kept up to date by a poller that syncs the vehicle VIN and "sold" status from the Inventory microservice every 60 seconds.
